# Presentation-template
### A template to create presentations in html5

## Use
Feel free to use it for your presentarions.
You can use "arrow rigth", "space", "d", or "left click" to advance to the next slide.
"arrow left" or "a" to go to the previous slide.
Default styles give you a consistent look and behaviour.

## Basic Slide
Every slide div will be a new slide.
A h1.slide-title will give you a header.
Just use html as usual! :)

```html
<div class="slide">
  <h1 class="slide-title">Slide title</h1>
  <p>I'm a slide!</p>
</div>
```
